Challenge 1: In 2020, April 28, 29 and 30 were days with very high revenue. That's why we want to focus in this task only on these days
(filter accordingly).
Find out what is the average payment amount grouped by customer and dayâ€“ consider only the days/customers with more than 1 payment (per customer and day).
Order by the average amount in a descending order.
